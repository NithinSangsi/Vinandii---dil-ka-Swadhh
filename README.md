# How It Works (Code Focus)

  vinandii.js initializes an Audio object and manages song playback.
  
  Event listeners handle play, pause, progress updates, and seeking.
  
  The function makeAllPlays() ensures only one song plays at a time.
  
  The playlist is defined in a JavaScript array with songName, filePath, and coverPath.
  
  Clicking a song updates the current index, loads the new file, and starts playback.

# Getting Started
 
1. Clone the Repository

          git clone https://github.com/NithinSangsi/Vinandii---dil-ka-Swadhh.git

# NOTE :

  Update the songs[]  array in vinandii.js to match your own songs.

  Ensure that the songs/ and images/ paths are correct.

  Works best on modern browsers (Chrome, Edge).

# Future Enhancements  
  (like shuffle, repeat, volume control, playlist from API) so it looks more professional on GitHub?
